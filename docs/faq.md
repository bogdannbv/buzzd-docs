# Frequently asked questions

??? question "What even is Buzzd Chat?"
    Buzzd Chat is a service that aims to bring back, as close to the original as possible, the Yahoo! Messenger experience.

??? question "Why is my account locked?"
    Your account can be locked if:  
    1. Your **email address is not verified**  
    2. You've **entered a wrong password multiple times**  
    3. You've **been banned**.  
    Solutions:  
    1. Make sure your email address is valid and that you've checked your spam folder for the verification email.  
    2. You can wait a couple of hours for your account to be unlocked automatically or contact us.  
    3. You can appeal your ban, though you'll most probably remain banned.

??? question "Why does it say that my ID is invalid?"
    Make sure you're entering the **username** you registered with and not your email address.  
    To find you your username, you can check [your profile page here](https://buzzd.chat/profile)

??? question "Why can't I see the Yahoo! Messenger logo at login or any audibles?"
    Most of the Yahoo! Messenger content is Flash based.
    You can [download Flash Player from here](./downloads/flash-player.md).

??? question "Will video and voice calls be available?"
    Both of these features rely on two completely different proprietary protocols.
    Reverse engineering them takes a lot of time and effort.
    Once more developers join the project, we'll be able to allocate more time to these features.

??? question "How do I use Pidgin/Trillian/other old 3rd party clients with Buzzd Chat?"
    Currently, **we support only the official clients**, and probably we'll never support any 3rd party clients.  
    We don't see the point of using a revival project with anything other than the official clients.  
    It doesn't make much sense, especially since **all 3rd party clients support only a small subset of all the official features**.  
    That being said, if anyone is interested in patching/updating a 3rd party client to work with our project, we're happy to help as much as reasonably possible.

??? question "Why can't I use Yahoo! Messenger 10 or 11.5?!?!"
    At the moment we're focusing on making as many features as possible functional.  
    Once we feel we're in a good place with the amount of features we've got working, we'll start working on supporting both older and newer versions.  
    Spoiler alert: we've already tested and got (almost fully) working versions 8.1 and 10, but are not yet ready to be released.

??? question "How long are you storing the messages for?"
    We're storing **only the offline messages** for up to 2 weeks.  
    Once the recipient logs in we're sending them the offline messages and delete them from our database.  
    If the recipient doesn't log in during that 2 weeks retention period, the messages get deleted automatically.

??? question "Who is behind Buzzd Chat?"
    The project was started by [**@bogdannbv**](https://github.com/bogdannbv) as a passion project around January 2024.  
    Later on, **@xsl1ck** joined and took over the community aspect of the project.

??? question "Is Buzzd Chat monetized in any way?"
    The short answer is **no**.  
    The long answer is that probably, as the project grows, the hosting cost will increase, and at some point we'll have to introduce either donations or merch or even both.  
    What's clear though is that we won't be "paywalling" the service or features in any way, shape or form.  
    All the donations will be completely optional.
